By assuming that the angle of sideslip is small, the wind velocity state estimates are corrected  whenever the EKF is not dead reckoning (e.g. has an independent velocity or position sensor such as GPS). This behaviour is on by default and cannot be disabled. When the EKF is dead reckoning, the wind states are used as a reference, enabling use of the small angle of sideslip assumption to correct non wind velocity states (eg attitude, velocity, position, etc) and improve navigation accuracy. This behaviour is on by default and cannot be disabled. The behaviour controlled by this parameter is the use of the small angle of sideslip assumption to correct non wind velocity states when the EKF is NOT dead reckoning. This is primarily of benefit to reduce the buildup of yaw angle errors during straight and level flight without a yaw sensor (e.g. magnetometer or dual antenna GPS yaw) provided aerobatic flight maneuvers with large sideslip angles are not performed. The 'always' option might be used where the yaw sensor is intentionally not fitted or disabled.

Estimated rotor speed increases/decreases between 0 (rotor stopped) to 1 (rotor at normal speed) in the RSC_RUNUP_TIME in seconds. This parameter should be set so that the estimated rotor speed goes below critical in approximately 3 seconds.  So if you had a 10 second runup time then set RSC_CRITICAL to 70%.,0 100,1,,
H_RSC_IDLE,Throttle output (HeliRSC Servo) in percent while armed but motor interlock is disabled (throttle hold on). FOR COMBUSTION ENGINES.

The collective should be at flat pitch and the throttle curve set to provide at least 50% of normal RPM at flat pitch. The autothrottle torque limiter will automatically activate and start accelerating the main rotor. If the autothrottle consistently fails to accelerate the main rotor during ramp-in due to engine tune or other factors, then increase the torque limiter setting.

Grid spacings lower than 100 meters waste SD card space if the GCS cannot provide that resolution. The grid spacing also controls how much data is kept in memory during flight. A larger grid spacing will allow for a larger amount of data in memory. A grid spacing of 100 meters results in the vehicle keeping 12 grid squares in memory with each grid square having a size of 2.7 kilometers by 3.2 kilometers.
