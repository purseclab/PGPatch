By assuming that the angle of sideslip is small, the wind velocity state estimates are corrected  whenever the EKF is not dead reckoning (e.g. has an independent velocity or position sensor such as GPS). This behaviour is on by default and cannot be disabled. When the EKF is dead reckoning, the wind states are used as a reference, enabling use of the small angle of sideslip assumption to correct non wind velocity states (eg attitude, velocity, position, etc) and improve navigation accuracy. This behaviour is on by default and cannot be disabled. The behaviour controlled by this parameter is the use of the small angle of sideslip assumption to correct non wind velocity states when the EKF is NOT dead reckoning. This is primarily of benefit to reduce the buildup of yaw angle errors during straight and level flight without a yaw sensor (e.g. magnetometer or dual antenna GPS yaw) provided aerobatic flight maneuvers with large sideslip angles are not performed. The 'always' option might be used where the yaw sensor is intentionally not fitted or disabled.

If your GCS is using the ArduPilot SRTM database like Mission Planner or MAVProxy, then a resolution of 100 meters is appropriate. Grid spacings lower than 100 meters waste SD card space if the GCS cannot provide that resolution. The grid spacing also controls how much data is kept in memory during flight. A larger grid spacing will allow for a larger amount of data in memory. A grid spacing of 100 meters results in the vehicle keeping 12 grid squares in memory with each grid square having a size of 2.7 kilometers by 3.2 kilometers. Any additional grid squares are stored on the SD once they are fetched from the GCS and will be loaded as needed.",,1,,
