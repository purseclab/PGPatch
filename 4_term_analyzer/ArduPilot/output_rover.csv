When the EKF is dead reckoning, the wind states are used as a reference, enabling use of the small angle of sideslip assumption to correct non wind velocity states (eg attitude, velocity, position, etc) and improve navigation accuracy. This behaviour is on by default and cannot be disabled. The behaviour controlled by this parameter is the use of the small angle of sideslip assumption to correct non wind velocity states when the EKF is NOT dead reckoning. This is primarily of benefit to reduce the buildup of yaw angle errors during straight and level flight without a yaw sensor (e.g. magnetometer or dual antenna GPS yaw) provided aerobatic flight maneuvers with large sideslip angles are not performed. The 'always' option might be used where the yaw sensor is intentionally not fitted or disabled.

If a GPS height measurement is also available, then the height of the WGS-84 height datum used by the EKF can be corrected so that the height returned by the getLLH() function is compensated for primary height sensor drift and change in datum over time. The first two bit positions control when the height datum will be corrected. Correction is performed using a Bayes filter and only operates when GPS quality permits.

EK3_DRAG_MCOEF,"This parameter is used to predict the drag produced by the rotors when flying a multi-copter, enabling estimation of wind drift. The drag produced by this effect scales with speed not speed squared and is produced because some of the air velocity normal to the rotors axis of rotation is lost when passing through the rotor disc which changes the momentum of the airflow causing drag. For unducted rotors the effect is roughly proportional to the area of the propeller blades when viewed side on and changes with different propellers. It is higher for ducted rotors. For example if flying at 15 m/s at sea level conditions produces a rotor induced drag acceleration of 1.5 m/s/s, then EK3_MCOEF would be set to 0.1 = (1.5/15.0). Set EK3_MCOEF to a postive value to enable wind estimation using this drag effect.
