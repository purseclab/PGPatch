EKF2_MAG_TYPE,"Integer controlling the type of magnetometer fusion used - magnetic heading or 3-component vector. The fuson of magnetomer data as a three component vector enables vehicle body fixed hard iron errors to be learned, but requires a stable earth field. If set to 'Automatic' magnetic heading fusion is used when on-ground and 3-axis magnetic field fusion in-flight with fallback to magnetic heading fusion if there is insufficient motion to make yaw or magnetic field states observable. If set to 'Magnetic heading' magnetic heading fusion is used at all times If set to '3-axis' 3-axis field fusion is used at all times. If set to 'VTOL custom' the behaviour is the same as 'Automatic', but if fusing airspeed, magnetometer fusion is only allowed to modify the magnetic field states. This can be used by VTOL platforms with large magnetic field disturbances to prevent incorrect bias states being learned during forward flight operation which can adversely affect estimation accuracy after transition to hovering flight. If set to 'MC custom' the behaviour is the same as 'Automatic, but if there are no earth frame position or velocity observations being used, the magnetometer will not be used. This enables vehicles to operate with no GPS in environments where the magnetic field cannot be used to provide a heading reference. Prior to flight, the yaw angle is assumed to be constant if movement tests indicate that the vehicle is static. This allows the vehicle to be placed on the ground to learn the yaw gyro bias prior to flight. If set to 'None' the magnetometer will not be used under any circumstance. If no external source of yaw is available, it is possible to use post-takeoff horizontal movement combined with GPS velocity measurements to align the yaw angle with the timer required (depending on the amount of movement and GPS data quality). Other external sources of yaw may be used if selected via the EKF2_AID_MASK parameter.",,0

EKF2_MCOEF,"This parameter controls the prediction of drag produced by the propellers when flying a multi-copter, which enables estimation of wind drift when enabled by the EKF2_AID_MASK parameter. The drag produced by this effect scales with speed not speed squared and is produced because some of the air velocity normal to the propeller axis of rotation is lost when passing through the rotor disc. This  changes the momentum of the flow which creates a drag reaction force. When comparing un-ducted propellers of the same diameter, the effect is roughly proportional to the area of the propeller blades when viewed side on and changes with propeller selection. Momentum drag is significantly higher for ducted rotors. For example, if flying at 10 m/s at sea level conditions produces a rotor induced drag deceleration of 1.5 m/s/s when the multi-copter levelled to zero roll/pitch, then EKF2_MCOEF would be set to 0.15 = (1.5/10.0). Set EKF2_MCOEF to a positive value to enable wind estimation using this drag effect. To account for the drag produced by the body which scales with speed squared, see documentation for the EKF2_BCOEF_X and EKF2_BCOEF_Y parameters.

It is intended to be used where a vertical takeoff and landing is performed, and horizontal flight does not occur until above EKF2_RNG_A_HMAX. If vehicle motion causes repeated switching between the primary height sensor and range finder, an offset in the local position origin can accumulate.
